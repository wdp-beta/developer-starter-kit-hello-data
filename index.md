# Hello Data!

As a developer using the Watson Data Platform you will frequently interacting with team members using [Data Science Experience](https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/getting-started/welcome-main.html?context=analytics), [Data Catalog](https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/catalog/manage-catalog.html?context=analytics) and [Data Refinery](https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/refinery/refining_data.html?context=analytics) user experiences. You may be referencing projects, catalogs and assets those people are working with.

This starter kit application illustrates how to discover and interact with project data sources using the [Watson Data Platform Core API](https://wdp-api-registry.mybluemix.net/api-explorer/). 

The application uses Node.js to navigate the project and asset structure, collect data asset information and then shows how to use that information to access a Cloudant database, a Db2 Warehouse on Cloud database and a data file that's stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage.
